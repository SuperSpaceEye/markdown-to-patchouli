* **Width** - Determines visual width of a constraint
* **Fullbright** - Determines whenever constraint will always be bright, or use brightness values from the world
* **Max Force** - Determines how much force a constraint can apply. <0 for max
* **Stiffness** - Determines how stiff a constraint is. <0 for max
* **Fixed Distance** - If <0, then calculates distance between points itself, if >=0, then uses given distance instead.
* **Hitpos Modes** - If constraint needs positions, this option will appear
* * **Normal** - Will use hit position as is.
* * **Centered On Side** - Will get the face of a block hit position is on, and use center of that face as position.
* * **Centered In Block** - Will get the block hit position is on, and use center of the block as position
* * **Precise Placement** - Will get the face of a block hit position is on, create n^n points (determined by Precise Placement Assist Sides) uniformly distributed across that face, and use closest point to hit position (will light up green)
* **Placement Assist Scroll Step** - Determines how big scroll step is of rotation in Placement Assist. In degrees
* **Distance From Block** - Determines how far away object will be after finishing Placement Assist.
